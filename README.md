## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve spent over three years as a QA Engineer, but my curiosity about how software really works led me to explore development. What started as automating some testing tasks quickly became a passion when I built Winston â€” a Python-powered Google Chat bot that helped my team work more efficiently. Seeing something I created in action, making a real difference, was a turning point for me. It made me want to dive deeper into software development and build things from the ground up.

My background in QA means I naturally think about quality and edge cases, which I believe gives me a unique perspective as I grow my coding skills. After completing General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Bootcamp, Iâ€™m excited to take the next step into a junior software engineering or full-stack developer role â€” one where I can keep learning, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow alongside a supportive team.
