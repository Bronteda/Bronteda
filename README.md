# 👋 Hi, I'm Bronteda

## About Me

With over three years of experience as a QA Engineer, my curiosity about how software works led me to explore development more deeply. What began as automating testing tasks soon turned into a passion—especially after building **Winston**, a Python-powered Google Chat bot that made my team’s workflow smoother and more efficient. Seeing my code in action and making a real impact was a turning point, inspiring me to pursue software engineering from the ground up.

One of my proudest projects is **Trifit**, a full-stack web application I created to help people train for triathlons. Trifit lets users plan, log, and monitor their training sessions, making it easier to stay on track for multi-sport events. Building Trifit allowed me to combine my technical skills with my interest in fitness, and taught me a lot about designing user-centric solutions that make a real difference.

My QA background means I naturally think about quality, reliability, and edge cases—giving me a unique perspective as I continue to grow as a developer. After graduating from General Assembly’s Software Engineering Bootcamp, I’m excited to take the next step as a Junior Software Engineer or Full-Stack Developer. I’m eager to keep learning, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow within a supportive team.
